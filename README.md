======

JavaScript client suite for the Metin2 Theoretical Attack Calculus Gear (TACG). 

This tool calculates the theoretical as well as the effective damage dealt by a Metin2 character considering all its bonuses/weapons/etc. It uses the empyrical game formulas found by metin2.it players Son Gohan and Mystikal, which can be found on <a href='http://wiki.metin2.it/index.php/Attacco'>this page</a> et al. (in Italian only, but the formulas themselves are quite self-explanatory).

Using
======
At the moment, due to some issues with JavaScript, the JSTACG suite is only compatible with Mozilla Firefox and derivated browsers, like Iceweasel or Waterfox. If you want to contribute in making the tool cross-browser, you're welcomed to lend a hand. 
The tool can be used online as well as offline.
